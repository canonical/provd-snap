#!/bin/bash
# Build the provd snap for CI (canonical/provd-snap, main).
#
# Mirrors the local go-build recipe minus the local-dev build-user/proxy
# wrappers (none of which apply on a GitHub-hosted runner): swap the
# core26-desktop base for a core26 placeholder for every snapcraft call,
# pack, restore the tracked yaml, then patch the packed snap's declared
# base back to core26-desktop.
#
# The snap's base is core26-desktop on purpose (see snap/snapcraft.yaml):
# the confined daemon talks to gdm/host helpers at compiled-in absolute
# paths, so its /usr must be the desktop variant rootfs, not the stock
# core26 base. snapcraft's schema validation rejects 'core26-desktop' as
# a base name, so the placeholder swap is required (same recipe as
# plasma-desktop-session's build-github.sh).
# SUFFIX (set by the workflow matrix) is appended to the published asset
# name ("" on amd64, "-arm64" on the arm64 leg).
